- One of the robust ways to build microservices in Java is using ***Spring Cloud***
- Example: Movie Catalog like IMDB

## Services VS Microservices
- **Service** is basically creating an application, which can be used in multiple applications.
    - Example: Payments gateway APIs used by multiple different kinds of platforms.
- **Microservices** is basically specific to a particular application.
    - Example: Shopping cart microservice used only by e-commerce applications.
